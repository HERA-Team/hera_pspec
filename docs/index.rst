HERA delay power spectrum estimation
====================================

The ``hera_pspec`` library provides all of the tools and data structures needed
to perform a delay spectrum analysis on interferometric data. The input data
can be in any format supported by ``pyuvdata``, and the output data are stored in
HDF5 containers.

You can find the code in the ``hera_pspec`` `GitHub repository <https://github.com/HERA-Team/hera_pspec>`_. A set of `example Jupyter notebooks <https://github.com/HERA-Team/hera_pspec/tree/master/examples>`_ are also available on GitHub.
